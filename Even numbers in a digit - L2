Even numbers in a digit - L2

Write a program, which will find all such numbers between the user-given range (both included) such that each digit of the number is an even number.

The numbers obtained should be printed in a comma-separated sequence on a single line.

Input Format:
The first input consists of an integer type to get starting value.
The second input consists of an integer type to get the ending value.

Output Format:
The output consists of all even digit numbers from the given range separated by a comma. If the range is out of bound, print "Invalid Input".

Constraints:
1>=n,m<=5000
program:
import java.util.*;
public class even
{
    public static void main(String args[])
    {
        Scanner sc=new Scanner(System.in);
        int n=sc.nextInt();
        int m=sc.nextInt();
        if(m<=5000)
        {
        for(int j=n;j<=n+2;j++)
        {
             if(j%2==0)
        {
            System.out.print(j);
        }
        }
        for(int i=n+2;i<=m;i++)
        {
            if(i%2==0)
        System.out.print(","+i);
        }
    }
    else
    System.out.print("Invalid Input");
    }
}
