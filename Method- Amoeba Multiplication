Method- Amoeba Multiplication

The environmental eco club  have discovered a new Amoeba that grows in the order of a Fibonacci series every month. They are exhibiting their amoeba in a national conference. They want to know the size of the amoeba at a particular time instant. If a particular month’s index is given can you write a  program that displays the amoeba’s size……???
//Use Dynamic Programming Strategy

Note: The size of the amoeba on month 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6,7 ..will be 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8 respectively.

import java.util.*;//scanner class
public class Amoeba//main class
{
    public static void main(String[] args)//function class
    {
     Scanner sc=new Scanner(System.in);//object class here the program starts
     System.out.println("Enter the number of Months:");//definition
     int n=sc.nextInt();
     int a=0,b=1,sum=0,i=2;
     while(i<n){
         sum=a+b;
         a=b;
          b=sum;
         i++;
     }
         System.out.printf("The amoeba size is %d",sum);
    }
}
//class amoeba1
class Amoeba1
{
    public static int sum(int n)//definition
    {
        int sum=n;
        return sum;
    }
}
